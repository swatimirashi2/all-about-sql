Let's practice: Set Operators
We can retrieve the data from different tables at a time using the Set Operators 
Syntax: Select * from TableOne Set Operator Select * from TableTwo; 
	1. UNION → combine results and remove duplicates
	2. UNION ALL → combine results and keep duplicates
	3. INTERSECT → get only the common rows
	4. EXCEPT / MINUS → get rows from the first query that are not in the second
Tip: Each query must have the same number of columns with compatible data types.

# Union Operator:
 
- Union Operator in one of the Operators in the four Set Operators 
- Purpose of Union Operator: 
- Practical Demonstration: 
create table empone(id int); 
insert into empone values(1); 
insert into empone values(3); 
insert into empone values(5); 
select * from empone; 
create table emptwo(num int); 
insert into emptwo values(2); 
insert into emptwo values(3); 
insert into emptwo values(4); 
select * from emptwo; 
select * from empone union select * from emptwo;  
- Combination of column records will be considered for comparison and elimination of duplicates 
- Rules: 
	1. Select statements of each table must retrieve the same number of columns 
	2. Columns provided in the select statements should have the similar data type to work properly 
	3. The order of the columns provided in the select statements should be same to work properly

# Union All Operator: 

- Union All Operator is one of the Set Operators 
- Unlike Union Operator, Union All won't eliminate the duplicates 
- Practical Demonstration: 
create table tone(id int); 
insert into tone values(1); 
insert into tone values(3); 
insert into tone values(5); 
select * from tone; 
create table ttwo(num int); 
insert into ttwo(2); 
insert into ttwo(3); 
insert into ttwo(4); 
select * from ttwo; 
select id from tone union all select num from ttwo;

# Intersect Operator:
 
- Intersect Operator is one of the Set Operators 
- Intersect Operator will retrieve the common records from the given tables 
- Intersect Operator is not supported by MySQL RDBMS 
- We have to use Oracle SQL RDMBS 
- Google search for 'Try Oracle SQL Online Practice' 
- Practical Demonstration: 
create table tone(id int); 
insert into tone values(1); 
insert into tone values(3); 
insert into tone values(5); 
select * from tone; 
create table ttwo(num int); 
insert into ttwo(2); 
insert into ttwo(3); 
insert into ttwo(4); 
select * from ttwo; 
select id from tone intersect select num from ttwo;

---

# Minus Operator:
 
- Minus Operator is one of the Set Operators 
- Minus Operator will retrieve the records in the first table and that are not available in the second table 
- Minus Operator is not supported by MySQL RDBMS 
- We have to use Oracle SQL RDMBS 
- Google search for 'Try Oracle SQL Online Practice' 
- Practical Demonstration:  
create table tone(id int); 
insert into tone values(1); 
insert into tone values(3); 
insert into tone values(5); 
select * from tone; 
create table ttwo(num int); 
insert into ttwo(2); 
insert into ttwo(3); 
insert into ttwo(4); 
select * from ttwo; 
select id from tone minus select num from ttwo; 
select id from two minus select num from tone;

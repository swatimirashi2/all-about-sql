Starting to work on an actual DBMS..., 
I initially practiced these SQL concepts in MySQL 
and am now transitioning to PostgreSQL 
to gain exposure to enterprise-grade relational database systems.

# Creating, Deleting, viewing and using Databases:

- Practical Demonstration:
- View existing databases.
- Create Database db_name;
- Refresh to see the Database Reflected
- Observe that the DB will be created without any below objects:
 	1. Tables
 	2. Views
 	3. Stored Procedures
- Drop Database db_name;
- Refresh to see the Database deleted
- Create Database db_name;
- Table is an object of a Database
- Syntax:
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype(size) constraint,
    column2 datatype(size) constraint,
    column3 datatype(size) constraint,
    ...
);
- view existing tables
Q. Write an SQL query to create a table named employees with the following columns:
	EmpID (int)
	EmpName (varchar(50))
	Department (varchar(30))
	Salary (int)
	Experience (int)	
- write query to display description of `employees` table.
- Write query to retrieve `employees` table.
Q. Write an SQL statement to create a new table named `Emp` by copying only the `id` and `name` columns from the existing `employees` table.
- drop table Emp;

---

# Insert Into Statements (For inserting data into Tables): 

- Practical Demonstration: 
Q. Write query to show all the tables from the current database.
Q. Write query to describe the structure of the employees table.
Q. Write query to insert single record (1, 'Arun', 12) into the employees table.
Q. Write query to insert two record (2, 'Varun', 5) and (3, 'Tharun', 7) into the employees table.
Q. Write query to insert the record (4, 'Alice') without providing the third column — observe what happens.
Q. Write query to insert only id and name for employee 4 so that the missing column gets NULL.
- Null value will be inserted in place of the non-inserted column if there is no integrity constraint applied on that column.

# Data Types:
 
- Every column in a Table has a Name and a data type 
- While creating a table, we have to decide the name and type for each and every column 
- Type of the Column decides the data that is expected in the specified table 

- Different types of data types: 
1. Numeric Data Types
	INT → whole numbers
	BIGINT → very large whole numbers
	SMALLINT → small range numbers
	FLOAT → decimal numbers (approximate)
	DOUBLE → larger decimal numbers
	DECIMAL(p,s) → exact decimal values (used in money calculations)

2. String / Character Data Types
	CHAR(n) → fixed-length string
	VARCHAR(n) → variable-length string(most used)
	TEXT → large text data

3. Date & Time  Data Types
	DATE → only date (YYYY-MM-DD)
	TIME → only time (HH:MM:SS)
	DATETIME → date + time
	TIMESTAMP → date + time (with automatic update features)

 5. Boolean Type
	BOOLEAN / BOOL → TRUE or FALSE

# Null Value, Is Null Operator and Is Not Null Operator:

- Practical Demonstration: 
- insert into Employees values(5,'Kiran'); -> Error 
- insert into Employees(id,name) values(5,'Kiran'); 
- select * from employees; 
- Write query to display all employees whose experience is NULL.
- Write query to display all employees whose experience is NOT NULL.
- Remember, we cannot use the assignment operator (=) with NULL; we must use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL.
- Because SQL does not compare NULL using =.
- NULL = NULL is never true — it returns UNKNOWN.
- So the condition fails for every row → result becomes empty.

# Delete Statement (For Deleting the Records from Table): 

- Practical Demonstration: 
Q. Write query to delete the employee whose id is 5.
Q. Write query to delete the employee whose name is 'Tharun'.
- Let's run: delete from employees;
- All rows will be deleted from the employees table.
- The table becomes empty, but the table structure remains.

---

# Update Statement and Set Keyword (For Updating the Table Records): 

- Practical Demonstration: 
Q. Drop n create employees table again
Q. Write query to insert a record (1, 'Arun', 12) into the `employees` table.
Q. Write query to insert a record (2, 'Varun', 5) into the `employees` table.
Q. Write query to insert a record (3, 'Tharun', 7) into the `employees` table.
Q. Write query to update the name of the employee whose id is 3 to 'Kiran'.
Q. Write query to update the name to 'Tharun' and id to 4 for the employee whose experience is 5.

---

# Rename Statement and To keyword (For Renaming Table Name): 

Practical Demonstration:  
Q. Write query to rename the table `employees` to `emp`.
Q. Write query to rename the table `emp` back to `employees`.
- for temporary table name we use alias method

---

# Alter Statement, `ADD`, `MODIFY COLUMN`, `RENAME COLUMN` and `DROP COLUMN` Keywords: 

- Practical Demonstration:  

- Check if needed: describe employees;
Q. Write query to add a new column `location` of type VARCHAR(15) to the `employees` table.
Q. Write query to modify the `location` column in the `employees` table to VARCHAR(20).
Q. Write query to rename the column `location` to `loc` in the `employees` table.
Q. Write query to drop the column `loc` from the `employees` table.

# Set Autocommit: 

- Practical Demonstration: 
insert into employees values(9,'Dinesh',3); 
Select * from employees; 
Restart the workbench client and observe that the inserted data is stored  
Select * from employees; 
set autocommit=0; 
insert into employees values(11,'Isha',6); 
Select * from employees; 
Restart the workbench client and observe that the inserted data is not stored  
Select * from employees; 
set autocommit=1; 
insert into employees values(11,'Isha',6); 
Select * from employees; 
Restart the workbench client and observe that the inserted data is stored 
Select * from employees;

---

# Commit Statement:
 
- Practical Demonstration: 
set autocommit=0; 
Select * from employees; 
insert into employees values(9,'Dinesh',3); 
Select * from employees; 
Restart the workbench client and observe that the inserted data is not permanently 
stored 
Select * from employees; 
insert into employees values(9,'Dinesh',3); 
commit; 
Select * from employees; 
Restart the workbench client and observe that the inserted data is stored permanently 
use qafox; 
Select * from employees; 
set autocommit=1;

---

# Rollback Statement:
 
- Practical Demonstration: 
set autocommit=0; 
Select * from employees; 
delete from employees; 
Select * from employees; 
rollback; 
delete from employees; 
commit; 
rollback; 
set autocommit=1;

---

# Truncate Statement:
 
- Practical Demonstration:
 
insert into employees values(1,'Arun',12); 
commit; 
set autocommit=0; 
delete from employees; 
rollback; 
Select * from employees; 
truncate table employees; 
rollback; 
Select * from employees; 
set autocommit=1;

# Single Line and Multi-Line Comments:
 
- Comments are the Statements which won't be executed like general SQL statements 
- Can be used for any of the below reasons: 
	1. To explain the underlying statements to make it understandable 
	2. To hide the statement from execution 
- Types of Comments in SQL: 
	1. Single Line Comments 
	2. Multi-Line Comments 
- Practical Demonstration: 
1. -- The below SQL statement is used to retrieve data from sql 
select * from employees;
3. /* The below SQL statements are used for finding the list of tables in the 
   database and to retrieve the records from the specified table */ 
show tables;

# Kick start learning SQL without installing any RDBMS

# Google Search for W3Schools Try SQL'

# Select Command:

* The purpose this SQL command is to retrieve the data from the tables
* Syntax: Select * from TableName;
* Practice select command:
* Retrieving all the data from Customers table
  Q: How would you retrieve all the data from the Customers table?
* Retrieving specific column data from Customers table
  Q: How would you retrieve only the `CustomerName` from the Customers table?
  Q: How would you retrieve `CustomerName`, `Country`, `City`, and `PostalCode` from the Customers table?

# distinct keyword:

* For unique values to be retrieved, we have to use distinct keyword with Select command
* Without distinct:
  Q: How would you retrieve all `Country` values from Customers including duplicates?
* With distinct:
  Q: How would you retrieve unique `Country` values from Customers?
  Q: How would you retrieve unique combinations of `Country` and `PostalCode` from Customers?

# SQL is not case sensitive:

* All the below statements will work same irrespective of their case
  Q: How would you retrieve `CustomerName` and `PostalCode` using SQL in a case-insensitive manner?

# Semicolon:

* Mandatory in some RDBMS Software
* Without Semicolon
* Why Semicolon
* Separating Multiple SQL Statements
  Q: Why is the semicolon used in SQL statements?

# Where Clause:

* Purpose is to filter records based on some condition
* Practice Where Clause:
  Q: How would you retrieve all records of customers from London?
  Q: How would you retrieve the customer with `CustomerID=9`?
  Q: How would you retrieve `CustomerName` and `Country` of customers where the city is London?

# Different Relational Operators we can use in Where Clause Condition:

* Equal Operator (=)
  Q: How would you retrieve products where `Price` is 40?
* Greater Than Operator (>)
  Q: How would you retrieve products where `Price` is greater than 40?
* Less Than Operator (<)
  Q: How would you retrieve products where `Price` is less than 40?
* Greater Than Or Equal To Operator (>=)
  Q: How would you retrieve products where `Price` is greater than or equal to 40?
* Less Than Or Equal To Operator (<=)
  Q: How would you retrieve products where `Price` is less than or equal to 40?
* Not Equal To Operator (<>)
  Q: How would you retrieve products where `Price` is not 40?

# Using Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT):

* Purpose: To filter the records based on Multiple Conditions
* Different Logical Operators we can use in Where Clause Condition

1. AND
   Q: How would you retrieve customers from Mexico with `CustomerID` greater than 3?
   Q: How would you retrieve customers from Mexico with `CustomerID` greater than 3 and `ContactName` not equal to 'Francisco Chang'?
2. OR
   Q: How would you retrieve customers from Germany or London?
   Q: How would you retrieve customers from Germany or London or `CustomerID` greater than 90?
3. NOT
   Q: How would you retrieve customers whose country is not Germany?
   Q: How would you retrieve customers whose country is not Germany and city is London?

# Between Operator:

* Purpose is to filter records based on some Range
  Q: How would you retrieve products with `Price` between 10 and 20?
  Q: How would you retrieve products with `Price` not between 10 and 20?
  Q: How would you retrieve products with `Price` less than 10 or greater than 20?

# Order By Clause

* Purpose is to order the retrieved records in ascending or descending order
  Q: How would you order customers by `Country` in ascending order?
  Q: How would you order customers by `Country` descending and `City` ascending?
  Q: How would you order products by `Price` in descending order?

# Using Between Operator with Text

Q: How would you retrieve customers whose `Country` is between 'Canada' and 'Finland'?
Q: How would you retrieve customers whose `Country` is not between 'Canada' and 'Finland'?

# In Operator

* Simplifies providing multiple values in Where Clause, when all the values are from the same column
  Q: How would you retrieve products where `Price` is 18, 30, or 10?
  Q: How would you retrieve customers whose `Country` is 'USA', 'Canada', or 'UK'?

# Like Operator and Wildcard Characters

* We can use Like Operator and Wildcard Characters for Pattern matching needs 
* We can use them in the Where Clause Conditions
  Q: How would you retrieve customers whose country ends with 'a'?
  Q: How would you retrieve customers whose country starts with 'F'?
  Q: How would you retrieve customers whose country contains 'Can'?
  Q: How would you retrieve customers whose country is exactly 2 characters?
  Q: How would you retrieve customers whose country matches the pattern 'M_x_c_'?

# Aliases for Table Column Names (As Keyword)

* While the records are retrieved these alias names provided for Column names will be displayed temporarily in place of Original Column names
  Q: How would you rename `CategoryID` as `ID` and `CategoryName` as `Name` in the output temporarily?
  Q: How would you use square brackets to alias `CategoryID` and `CategoryName`?

# Limit Keyword

* When a Table has 1000's of records, the Application will slow down when trying to display them. 
* Using Limit keyword we can decide how many records needs to be displayed on the page irrespective of number of records available, thereby improving the performance
  Q: How would you retrieve only 3 records from Customers?
  Q: How would you retrieve 5 records from Customers where `Country` is 'USA'?
  Q: How would you retrieve records 2 to 6 from Customers?

# Breaking the Lengthy SQL Statement into multiple lines

* We can break the lengthy SQL statement into multiple lines for better understanding
  Q: How would you retrieve `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, `Country`, and `City` from Customers where `Country` is 'France' using multiple lines?

# Arithmetic Operators

* The below are the different Arithmetic Operators we can use in the SQL Statements:

1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Modulus (%)
   Q: How would you add 5 and 4 using SQL?
   Q: How would you subtract 4 from 5 using SQL?
   Q: How would you multiply 5 and 4 using SQL?
   Q: How would you divide 5 by 4 using SQL?
   Q: How would you calculate 5 modulus 4 using SQL?
   Q: How would you increase the `Price` by 10 for all products?
   Q: How would you decrease the `Price` by 10 for all products?
   Q: How would you multiply the `Price` by 10 for all products?
   Q: How would you divide the `Price` by 10 for all products?
   Q: How would you calculate the modulus of `Price` by 10 for all products?

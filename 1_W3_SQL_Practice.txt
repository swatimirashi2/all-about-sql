First, let's discuss some basics:
# Database: 
* A database is a structured place where data is stored in an organized way.

# DBMS(Database Management System):
* A DBMS is the software that manages that (database)data  
* and performs operations like storing, retrieving, updating, deleting...

# Data Model:
* A data model is a logical blueprint that defines how data is structured, related, and organized in a database 
* by specifying entities, attributes, and relationships.
* Types of Data Models: Hierarchical Model, Entity-Relationship Model, Relational Model, Network Model.

# Entities, Attributes, and Relationships:
* In a data model, entities are the objects we store data about, like tables, views, indexes, or materialized views. * Attributes are their properties, like EID, EName, or Salary. 
* Relationships define how entities are connected, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.

# RDBMS(Relational Database Management System):
* RDBMS is a type of DBMS software that follows the relational data model. 
* In RDBMS systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL, data is stored in tables with rows and columns, 
* and these tables are connected using primary and foreign keys to maintain relationships and ensure data integrity. 

# SQL:
* A programming language for RDBMS used to perform operations on databases.
* Stands for Structured Query Language.
* Using SQL, we can perform operations on a database such as inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

# Select Command:

* The purpose of this SQL command is to retrieve the data from the tables
* Syntax: Select * from TableName;
* Practical Demonstration:
  Q: Write a query to display all the data from the Customers table
* Retrieving specific column data from Customers table
  Q: Write a query to display only the `CustomerName` from the Customers table
  Q: Write a query to display `CustomerName`, `Country`, `City`, and `PostalCode` from the Customers table

---

# distinct keyword:

* To retrieve unique values, we use distinct keyword with Select command
* Without distinct:
  Q: Write a query to display all `Country` values from Customers including duplicates
* With distinct:
  Q: Write a query to display unique `Country` values from Customers
  Q: Write a query to display unique combinations of `Country` and `PostalCode` from Customers
* We Observed that, Combination of Country and PostalCode should be unique

---

# SQL is not case sensitive:

* All the below statements will work same irrespective of their case

1. Select CustomerName,PostalCode from Customers;
2. select customername,postalcode from customers;
3. SELECT CUSTOMERNAME,POSTALCODE FROM CUSTOMERS;

* Let't Check...

# Semicolon:

* To end sql statements we use semicolon.
* Mandatory in some RDBMS Software.
* Without Semicolon
* Why Semicolon
* main purpose is to Separating Multiple SQL Statements 

---

# Where Clause:

* Purpose is to filter records based on some condition
* When we use where clause inside the select statement we will be able to filter those data using some conditions 
* Using relational operators(=,>,<,>=,<=,<>) we write where condition
* And for multiple conditions inside where clause we use logical operators like AND, OR
* Practical Demonstration:
  Q: Write a query to display all records of customers from London
  Q: Write a query to display the customer with `CustomerID=9`
  Q: Write a query to display `CustomerName` and `Country` of customers where the city is London

---

# Different Relational Operators we can use in Where Clause Condition:

* Equal Operator (=)
  Q: Write a query to display products where `Price` is 40
* Greater Than Operator (>)
  Q: Write a query to display products where `Price` is greater than 40
* Less Than Operator (<)
  Q: Write a query to display products where `Price` is less than 40
* Greater Than Or Equal To Operator (>=)
  Q: Write a query to display products where `Price` is greater than or equal to 40
* Less Than Or Equal To Operator (<=)
  Q: Write a query to display products where `Price` is less than or equal to 40
* Not Equal To Operator (<>)
  Q: Write a query to display products where `Price` is not 40

---

# Using Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT):

* Purpose: To filter the records based on Multiple Conditions
* Different Logical Operators we can use in Where Clause Condition

1. AND
   Q: Write a query to display customers from Mexico with `CustomerID` greater than 3
   Q: Write a query to display customers from Mexico with `CustomerID` greater than 3 and `ContactName` not equal to 'Francisco Chang'
2. OR
   Q: Write a query to display customers from Germany or London
   Q: Write a query to display customers from Germany or London or `CustomerID` greater than 90
3. NOT
   Q: Write a query to display customers whose country is not Germany
   Q: Write a query to display customers whose country is not Germany and city is London

---

# Between Operator:

* Purpose is to filter records based on specified Range
* Practical Demonstration:
  Q: Write a query to display products with `Price` between 10 and 20
  Q: Write a query to display products with `Price` not between 10 and 20
  Q: Write a query to display products with `Price` less than 10 or greater than 20

---

# Order By Clause:

* Purpose is to order the retrieved records in ascending or descending order
* Practical Demonstration:
  Q: Write a query to display customers by `Country` in ascending order
* ASC is optional
* But for descending we need to write DESC, So DESC is mandatory.
  Q: Write a query to display customers by `Country` descending and `City` ascending
  Q: Write a query to display products by `Price` in descending order

---

# Using Between Operator with Text:

* BETWEEN operator is not only used with numbers and dates — it also works with text values.
* Practical Demonstration:
  Q: Write a query to display all the records from the Customers table
  Q: Write a query to display all customers in ascending order
  Q: Write a query to display customers whose Country name alphabetically falls BETWEEN ‘Canada’ and ‘Finland’
  Q: Write a query to display customers whose Country name does NOT fall alphabetically between ‘Canada’ and ‘Finland’

---

# In Operator:

* allows you to filter a column against multiple values in a single query, 
* simplifying the process, instead of writing multiple OR conditions.
* Practical Demonstration:
  Q: Write a query to display products where `Price` is 18, 30, or 10
  Q: Write a query to display customers whose `Country` is 'USA', 'Canada', or 'UK'

---

# Like Operator and Wildcard Characters:

* We can use Like Operator and Wildcard Characters for Pattern matching needs
* We can use them in the Where Clause Conditions
* Practical Demonstration:
  Q: Write a query to display customers whose country ends with 'a'
  Q: Write a query to display customers whose country starts with 'F'
  Q: Write a query to display customers whose country contains 'Can'
  Q: Write a query to display customers whose country is exactly 2 characters
  Q: Write a query to display customers whose country matches the pattern 'M_x_c_'
* When we do pattern matching using wildcard characters that time instead of equal to operator 
* we use like operator otherwise get an error
* Wildcard characters:
	% - multi char 
	_ - single char

# Aliases for Table Column Names (As Keyword):

* If we don’t want the original column name to display in the result, we can specify an alias name. 
* alias is temporary, which means it does not change the original column in the table. 
* AS keyword is optional, but it is better to use it for more readability.
  Q: Write a query to display `CategoryID` as `ID` and `CategoryName` as `Name` in the output temporarily
  Q: Write a query to use square brackets to alias `CategoryID` and `CategoryName`

---

# Limit Keyword:

* When a Table has 1000's of records, the Application will slow down when trying to display them.
* Using Limit keyword we can decide how many records needs to be displayed on the page irrespective of number of records available, thereby improving the performance
* Practical Demonstration
  Q: Write a query to display only 3 records from Customers
  Q: Write a query to display 5 records from Customers where `Country` is 'USA'
  Q: Write a query to display records 2 to 6 from Customers

---

# Breaking the Lengthy SQL Statement into multiple lines:

* We can break the lengthy SQL statement into multiple lines for better understanding
  Q: Write a query to display `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, `Country`, and `City` from Customers where `Country` is 'France' using multiple lines

---

# Arithmetic Operators:

* The below are the different Arithmetic Operators we can use in the SQL Statements:

1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Modulus (%)

* Practical Demonstration
  Q: Write a query to display 5 + 4
  Q: Write a query to display 5 - 4
  Q: Write a query to display 5 * 4
  Q: Write a query to display 5 / 4
  Q: Write a query to display 5 % 4
  Q: Write a query to increase the `Price` by 10 for all products
  Q: Write a query to decrease the `Price` by 10 for all products
  Q: Write a query to multiply the `Price` by 10 for all products
  Q: Write a query to divide the `Price` by 10 for all products
  Q: Write a query to display the modulus of `Price` by 10 for all products
